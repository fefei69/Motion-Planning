# ECE276B PR2 Spring 2024

## Overview
In this assignment, you will implement and compare the performance of search-based and sampling-based motion planning algorithms on several 3-D environments.
## Searh-based method - Weighted A*
```
python astar_v3.py
```
## Sampling-based method 
- RRT*
- RRT-connected
- Bidirectional RRT*
```
python rrt_bid.py --test_case single_cube --alg rrt_cons
```
